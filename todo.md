- first texture-cover on plain
- decide what text should appear on input in input element and canvas
- background (maybe sky gradient or its image)
- move from span.offsetWidth to ctx.measureText(text) to get { width, ...actualBoundingBox }
- if (word width > plain width) move last letter on new line
- empty spaces on line endings
